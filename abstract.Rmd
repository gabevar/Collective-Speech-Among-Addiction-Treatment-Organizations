abstract: \noindent\setstretch{1}The market for addiction treatment has transformed radically in response to the opioid epidemic and regulatory changes. An influx of for-profit addiction treatment services has been met with skepticism and reports of patient abuse. As a result, for-profit organizations are under disproportionate amounts of normative pressure, raising the question`:`what strategies will for-profits adopt to legitimize their practice? By examining the online speech of every addiction treatment service in New York State, this article highlights the extent to which for-profit, non-profit and public organizations use collective and distinctive language. I find that while for-profit and public organizations exhibit some collective speech, non-profits do not. Auxiliary analysis also reveal that for-profit organizations use different repertoires of language when describing patients and clients. Overall, results suggests that language coheres, or fails to cohere, differently given ownership type. \vspace{.8cm}
